# Smart-Display-System-for-Products

This Smart Display Desk System is to smartly display for products.

Once a user/customer picks the product item from desk/shelf, the relevant video/specification/info of that specific product will be displayed on the screen.

Node.js is used to take inputs from Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins to display the product accordingly on the webpage.
